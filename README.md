## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where Iâ€™m exploring backend infrastructure topics, with a focus on load balancing and service discovery. This space serves as a hands-on learning hub for understanding how modern backend systems scale, stay resilient, and efficiently route traffic across multiple services.

As a backend developer, I'm currently diving deeper into distributed architecturesâ€”specifically how services communicate reliably and how traffic is managed at scale. Load balancing plays a critical role in distributing requests evenly across servers, improving performance, and reducing downtime. Alongside this, service discovery ensures that components in a dynamic environment can find and interact with each other without manual configuration.

In this repository, you'll find experiments, code samples, and simple setups using tools like Nginx, HAProxy, Consul, and Docker to simulate and understand real-world patterns. Iâ€™m also working with cloud-native concepts, exploring how container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes handle service discovery and load balancing internally.

Each project is designed to be modular, documented, and beginner-friendlyâ€”aimed at both reinforcing my own understanding and providing a reference for others who are curious about these foundational concepts. Topics include round-robin and least-connections load balancing strategies, DNS-based service discovery, health checks, failover handling, and integrating with microservices.

This is a work-in-progress collection of learnings and experiments. I aim to keep expanding it with more advanced topics like dynamic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and observability practices.

If you're a backend developer or infrastructure enthusiast looking to understand how services stay available, discoverable, and balanced in distributed systems, I hope you find this repository useful. Feedback and collaboration are welcome as I continue to build knowledge and explore more advanced backend infrastructure topics.
